This repository contain features and functionality complementing [MVVM Dialogs](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/mvvm-dialogs).

## Features

### COM shell dialogs (contribution by [@Dai](https://github.com/Jehoel))

The COM shell dialogs are an alternative to the default WinForms framework dialogs. They are more contemporary and have a visual style that aligns well with later versions of Windows. See the [wiki](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/mvvm-dialogs-contrib/wiki/COM-shell-dialogs) for more information.
